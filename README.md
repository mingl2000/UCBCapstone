# UCB Capstone for AI/ML class

## Introduction

* It's often said that futures traders are the "smart money." This study explores whether the public data of top 20 futures contract traders daily (across 7 columns, updated daily) can be leveraged to improve trading outcomes.
* Specifically, we investigate if this data can enhance predictions of the CSI index performance.

## Data Sources

* **CSI 300 Index Futures**: From [CFFEX](http://www.cffex.com.cn), including daily top 20 traders by volume and other metrics.
* **CSI 300 Index Historical Data**: From Yahoo Finance.

## Data Preprocessing

* Futures data from **January 4, 2021** onwards was collected.
* **Top 50 dealers** were selected based on total trading volume over the entire period.
* Each day's net long/short positions for these 50 dealers were organized into a single row. If a dealer has no data for a specific day, a value of 0 was used.
* The futures data was merged with the CSI index daily return data to form a dataset like:

```
| Date       | Dealer1 | Dealer2 | Dealer3 | CSI return (next day) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|------------------------|
| 2025-01-02 |  -100   |   80    |  -70    |         -0.01         |
| 2025-01-03 |   200   |  -100   |   70    |         -0.02         |
```

## Dealer Analysis

* Top 50 dealers account for over **97%** of the total trading volume.
* Top 100 dealers account for over **99%**.
* Therefore, the **top 50 dealers** are used for all further analysis.

## Information Coefficient (IC) Analysis

The **Information Coefficient** between futures contract trading data and next-day CSI index returns are analyzed in addition to RMSE.

* **Per data column (aggregated across dealers):**

  * `volume`: End-of-day contract volume
  * `volchange`: Daily change in contract volume
  * `buyvol`: End-of-day buy contract volume
  * `buyvolchange`: Daily change in buy contract volume
  * `sellvol`: End-of-day sell contract volume
  * `sellvolchange`: Daily change in sell contract volume
  * `net_vol_diff`: `buyvolchange - sellvolchange`

* **Per dealer:**

  * The two largest dealers showed IC â‰ˆ **0.1**
  * One smaller dealer had an IC â‰ˆ **0.3**, but their data was not consistently available and their trading volume was small.




### IC from Model Predictions vs. Actual CSI Index Return % (Next Day)

* **Following models are tried and compared** and **LinearRegression** is used as **baseline model**.
  - LinearRegression
  - KnnRegressor
  - DecisionTreeRegressor
  - SupportVectorRegressor
  - TransformedTargetRegressor
  - VotingRegressor using the following models:
    - LinearRegression
    - KnnRegressor
    - DecisionTreeRegressor
    - SupportVectorRegressor
    - TransformedTargetRegressor
  - AdoBoost
  - XgbBoost
  - TensorFlow 


  * IC = **-0.238**, which is significantly better than raw ICs from futures data
  * Grid-searched model achieves similar IC

* **Test result**:
  Here is the test summary across multiple models and mutliple csi index future products.
    - For some index future products, such as IC, the Information Coefficient% seem to be higher acoss models. 
    - Please notem the **Information Coefficient% is 100 times of Information Coefficient**.
    - Generally speaking, the RMSE is fairely consistent between models and across products with exception XgbBoost for IM.
      - More turning for XgbBoost may be needed.

* **Insights**:
  * **LinearRegression** does not offer best RMSE in general across all products.
    - But for some products, like **IC**, information coefficient from LinearRegression is very impressive to be 0.27 or 27% reported above.

  * **Tensorflow** model:
    - It seems to be strange that the mighty Tensorflow did not offer best RMSE nor information coefficient:
      - The data may be linear by nature.
      - The Tensorflow model may be too complicated.
      - Different Tensorflow model may be needed where Keras turning may help.

  * For index future product **IC**, the information coefficient is consistently high across most of models, except KnnRegressor and Tensorflow
    - This indicates that there is a strong correlation between the CSI index change next day and this future product trading info.
    - This product may offer best insight for CSI index trading. 

  * **IH**,**IF** and **IM** futures show less predictive power for their corresponding ETF returns.
    - When Information Coefficient (IC) is **positive**, when prediction is **positive**, **positive** return next day is expected. 



### Try with AdaBoostRegressor for all CSI future index products
    - Information Coefficient (IC) for product IC got -0.22 which is much more significent than the 0.02 from Regressor

## Study Conclusions

* While large dealers show modest correlation with CSI returns, some smaller dealers (with intermittent data) showed higher correlations.

  * This suggests futures contracts may often be used for **hedging** rather than speculation.
* For CSI index future product "IC", multiple models yielded a high absoute value of Information Coefficient (IC):
  * This could be leveraged to enhance ETF trading performance (e.g., 510500.SS ).

*

## Future Work

* **Backtesting** strategies based on model predictions:
  * Compare against a simple "buy and hold" strategy for CSI 300
  * Evaluate whether AI-based strategies provide better returns

* **Expand data sources**:

  * Identify top `n` individual stocks where futures data correlates highly with stock return the next day
  * Investigate whether this selective strategy outperforms direct index-based trading
